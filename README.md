# Data_Analysis_and_Visualization_Netflix
In this project, we analyzed and visualized the Netflix-Original-Films-IMDB-Scores dataset from Kaggle using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The project involved exploring film ratings, trends, and patterns through data analysis and creating visualizations to gain insights into Netflix's original films and their performance on IMDb.
